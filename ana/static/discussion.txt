1. Classifier Agent (First Layer)
Role:
	‚Ä¢ Acts as the entry point for all incoming tickets.
	‚Ä¢ Classifies the ticket based on user text (short/long prompts).
	‚Ä¢ Adds metadata required for routing:
		‚óã Category (one of the 6 categories)
		‚óã Severity (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical)
		‚óã Urgency (e.g., Immediate, Today, This Week)
Responsibilities:
	1. Text processing: Normalize and understand user prompt.
	2. Category tagging: Assign one of the 6 main categories.
	3. Severity & urgency assessment: Based on keywords (e.g., ‚Äúcannot login‚Äù ‚Üí High/Immediate).
	4. Forwarding: Send classified ticket to the relevant specialized agent in layer 2.
Why it helps:
	‚Ä¢ Separates general understanding from expert processing, making the system modular.
	‚Ä¢ Easy to add new categories in future without retraining category-specific agents.
	‚Ä¢ Acts as a bottleneck to maintain consistency in ticket metadata.

2. Category-Specialized Agents (Second Layer)
Structure:
	‚Ä¢ Each category has its own specialized agent.
	‚Ä¢ These agents handle expert processing and resolution suggestions.
Agents in Layer 2:
	1. Access & Authentication Agent
	2. Networking & Connectivity Agent
	3. Hardware / Device Agent
	4. Software / Applications Agent
	5. Collaboration & Productivity Tools Agent
	6. Security & Compliance Agent
Responsibilities of Each Specialized Agent:
	‚Ä¢ Understand category-specific user prompts in detail.
	‚Ä¢ Suggest solutions or next steps:
		‚óã Auto-resolve common issues (password reset, VPN reconnection, etc.)
		‚óã Create structured ticket for human intervention if needed
	‚Ä¢ Validate mandatory fields based on category & issue.
	‚Ä¢ Optionally, predict estimated resolution time.
Why it helps:
	‚Ä¢ Each agent focuses on a narrow domain, making it accurate and efficient.
	‚Ä¢ Layer 2 agents can be updated independently (e.g., VPN rules change ‚Üí only Networking Agent retrained).
	‚Ä¢ Supports scaling horizontally: can add more category agents or sub-specialists without affecting the classifier.

3. Ticket Flow Example
	1. User submits a ticket: ‚ÄúVPN keeps disconnecting while working from home.‚Äù
	2. Classifier Agent:
		‚óã Category ‚Üí Networking & Connectivity
		‚óã Severity ‚Üí High
		‚óã Urgency ‚Üí Immediate
	3. Networking & Connectivity Agent:
		‚óã Checks known issues, VPN logs, proxy rules
		‚óã Suggests solution or escalates to human IT support
		‚óã Ensures mandatory fields (device_name, vpn_client_version, location) are captured
